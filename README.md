# CaesarCipher

Implement the Caesar Cipher with a Python or C++ program. 

Your program should offer the option to encrypt or decrypt.  You may use a standard shift of 3 

or allow the user to decide the shift.  The user should be able to enter text to encrypt or decrypt.

Decrypting should result in a plaintext message.
